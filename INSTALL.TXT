Introduction
============

This file describes the installation procedures for the following QLogic Linux
drivers:

- QED (QLogic Everest Driver) core module for QL4xxx Series converged network
  interface cards.

- QEDE (Qlogic Everest Driver for Ethernet) networking driver for QL4xxx Series
  converged network interface cards.

- QEDR (QLogic Everest Driver for RoCE) driver for QL4xxx series of converged
  network interface cards.

- LIBQEDR (QLogic Everest Library for RoCE) userspace driver for QL4xxx series
  of converged network interface cards.

- QEDF (QLogic Everest Driver for FoCE) driver for QL4xxx series of converged
  network interface cards.

- QEDI (QLogic Everest Driver for iSCSI) driver for QL4xxx series of converged
  network interface cards.

Installation of Kernel Drivers
==============================

1. Create a directory and extract the FastLinQ package files:

   `tar xvjf fastlinq-<version>.tar.bz2'

2. Change to the recently created directory:

   `cd fastlinq-<version>'

3. Build and install the kernel drivers as loadable modules for the running
   kernel:

   `make install'


Loading and Removing Kernel Drivers
===================================

- Loading a kernel driver:

  `modprobe <qed/qede/qedr/qedf/qedi>'

  Due to dependency between the drivers, probing of QEDE will probe also QED,
  and probing of QEDR will probe also QEDE and QED.

- Removing a kernel driver:

  `rmmod <qedi/qedf/qedr/qede/qed>'


Installation of Userspace Driver
================================

1. Create a directory and extract the FastLinQ package files:

   `tar xvjf fastlinq-<version>.tar.bz2'

2. Change to the recently created directory:

   `cd fastlinq-<version>'

3. Build and install the LIBQEDR userspace library:

   `make libqedr_install'
